      <h1>What are Boids?</h1>
      <p>
        Boids is a term short for a bird-like-objects and is used in reference
        to simple flocking algorithms. A Boid has 3 main traits that determine
        how it moves in reference to other Boids: coherence/cohesion,
        separation/avoidance, and alignment.
      </p>
      <h2>Cohesion:</h2>
      <p>
        Cohesion/Coherence is the property of how Boids group to a center of
        mass (average position of all Boids). A lower cohesion value will result
        in Boids moving to the center of mass slower, while a higher cohesion
        value speeds up this process. The end result of Cohesion is one large
        group of Boids with no outliers.
      </p>
      <h2>Separation:</h2>
      <p>
        Separation/Avoidance is the property of how Boids stay away from one
        another. While cohesion groups Boids together into one mass separation
        creates empty space between each Boid to allow for easy recognition of
        individual Boids. A lower separation value will result in less empty
        space between Boids, while a higher separation value will result in more
        empty space. Separation is not a strict boundary. Boids will not be
        blocked from crashing into each other or entering the empty space set by
        separation. Instead the Boids’ velocities will change to move away from
        each other in the instance that they are too close.
      </p>
      <h2>Alignment:</h2>
      <p>
        Alignment is the property that allows Boids to steer near the local
        heading of the group. This is similar to cohesion as it groups boids in
        a similar direction, however it utilizes the visual range of each boid
        to determine the direction its nearest neighbors are moving in. A higher
        visual range and alignment value will result in the speeding up of this
        process while a lower visual range and alignment value will make it
        occur more slowly. The end result of this process is Boid group members
        moving in a similar direction.
      </p>
